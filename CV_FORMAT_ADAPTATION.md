# CV Format Adaptation Summary

## Overview
Successfully adapted the PDF generation system to match the format and layout of the provided `.docx` file.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Content Structure Adaptation (`docs/LePhucDuc_CV.dox`)
- **Header Format**: Changed to match the centered name format from the .docx
- **Contact Line**: Reformatted contact information to single line with pipe separators
- **Section Organization**: Restructured to match the .docx section order and style:
  - SKILLS (with subsections for Programming, Automotive, Tools)
  - EDUCATION (with right-aligned dates using table format)
  - WORK EXPERIENCE (with structured company info and position details)
- **Content Layout**: Used tables and markdown formatting to achieve right-aligned dates
- **Achievement Sections**: Added dedicated achievement sections under each position

### 2. LaTeX Styling (`build_environment/tool/doxygen/Doxyfile.in`)
- **Font**: Changed to Times New Roman to match .docx (`times` package)
- **Layout**: Added `geometry` and `titlesec` packages for better spacing control
- **PDF Engine**: Switched from XeLaTeX to pdfLaTeX for better compatibility
- **Compact Format**: Enabled `COMPACT_LATEX = YES` for tighter spacing

### 3. Additional Styling Package (`build_environment/tool/doxygen/cv_style.sty`)
- Created LaTeX style package for fine-tuning appearance
- Configured for Times font, compact margins, and centered section headers
- Removed page numbers to match .docx format

## Technical Implementation

### Content Processing Flow
1. **Source**: `.dox` file with Doxygen markup adapted to match .docx structure
2. **Processing**: Doxygen parses content and generates LaTeX with enhanced packages
3. **Compilation**: pdfLaTeX compiles with Times font and compact formatting
4. **Output**: Professional PDF matching .docx appearance and structure

### Build Integration
- Maintained existing CMake build system
- Updated Doxygen configuration for better PDF formatting
- Enhanced build script with improved status reporting
- Added file size tracking (49KB output)

## Usage
The adapted system now generates a PDF that closely mirrors the provided .docx file while maintaining the automated build process and easy content updates through the `.dox` source file.

Build command remains the same:
```bash
./build_cv.sh
```

## Future Improvements
- Further fine-tune spacing to match .docx exactly
- Add support for additional formatting elements if needed
- Consider adding automated .docx to .dox conversion tools
